# Project Overview

Below is the brief for this project:

"In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in."


## How to run.

* Clone or download this GitHub repository to your local machine.
* Open index.html in your favorite web browser.
* The website should run through each test and display the website, the results from the test can be seen at the bottom of the page.
